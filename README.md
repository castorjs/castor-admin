# ezMaster

> Last version of ezMaster is no more in this repository.

Current version (v2+) is in [Inist-CNRS/ezmaster](https://github.com/Inist-CNRS/ezmaster).

The main difference is that ezMaster 2+ uses docker in place of pm2, and thus can handle not only nodejs applications.

The last version of ezmaster 1.2 is in [v1.x branch](https://github.com/madec-project/ezmaster/tree/v1.x).
